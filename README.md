#Little-Apps

This repository is a collection of small applications, scripts and resources that I've created so that I don't have to clutter up my GitHub account with lots of unnecessary repositories. Below is a list of apps that are currently in the repository:

* **Base2Base.py** - this is a simple Python function that will convert an integer through different specified number bases
* **boggle.java** - a simple command line java app for cheating at Boggle - requires englishwords.txt (you could adapt to other languages but change some of the code first)
* **englishwords.txt** - a full English word list I've built from other word lists
* **Passcode.java** - a simple Java command line to check if a four digit passcode is based on a specific four letter word
* **snow.js** - a JS script that adds falling snow to a page
* **windowcenter.scpt** - a simple AppleScript for centering windows horizontaly on the screen


##Stuff that will be in here
I plan to eventually add all of my Project Euler solutions (mostly Python, some Java) along with some dumb classes that I've written to easy Android, iOS and .Net Development.

##License
