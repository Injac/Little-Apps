#Little-Apps

This repository is a collection of small applications, scripts and resources that I've created so that I don't have to clutter up my GitHub account with lots of unnecessary repositories. Below is a list of apps that are currently in the repository:

* **Base2Base.py** - this is a simple Python function that will convert an integer through different specified number bases
* **windowcenter.scpt** - a simple AppleScript for centering windows horizontaly on the screen

##Stuff that will be in here
I plan to eventually add all of my Project Euler solutions (mostly Python, some Java) along with some dumb classes that I've written to easy Android, iOS and .Net Development.

##License
I'm tentatively saying that although I haven't put the appropriate notices in files *all source code (including XML/HTML/CSS etc)* is Apache 2.0 licensed and all other files are public domain unless specified otherwise.
